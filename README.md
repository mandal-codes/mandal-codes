# Shubham Mandal — iOS / SwiftUI Developer

I build production-grade iOS apps: SwiftUI/UIKit, async/await, clean architecture, performance, and App Store delivery.

## What I can do for you
- Build SwiftUI screens & flows (pixel-perfect, responsive)
- Architecture refactors (MVVM / Coordinator / modularization)
- API integration + offline caching + error handling
- Subscriptions (RevenueCat / StoreKit), analytics, deep links
- Performance fixes (startup time, scrolling, memory)

## Featured Work
- ✅ AI Chat App (WIP) — clean modules, testable code, documentation

## Tech
Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, async/await, XCTest, CoreData/SQLite, REST, Git, CI basics
